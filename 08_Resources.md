For years the narrative that has been pushed regarding Bitcoin mining is that it’s a fool’s game, better left to the professional mining farms and big players due to shrinking profitability. This guide aims to show that this is overly simplistic and narrow-minded in its view. In fact, as ways to acquire BTC without going through the dangerous KYC/AML verification process shrink, mining becomes more and more intriguing for the average user.

[Stratum V2: Migration and Decentralization](https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/stratum-v2-migration-and-decentralization/) by [@karimhelpme](https://twitter.com/karimhelpme) 

Specialized tooling is an underappreciated but critical component of the Bitcoin ecosystem. As the base layer in the ecosystem’s technology stack, Bitcoin’s core protocol does not include all the functionality necessary for every type of user to easily participate in the network.

[Bitcoin Miner Transaction Fee Gathering Capability](https://blog.bitmex.com/bitcoin-miner-transaction-fee-gathering-capability/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=bitmexresearch&utm_term=&utm_content=&utm_campaign=bitcoinminer) by [@BitMEXResearch](https://twitter.com/BitMEXResearch) 

In this report we discuss a new proposed mining pool, expected to censor certain transactions. This may result in a detectable diversion from the typical revenue maximisation transaction selection policy, which forms the basis of our analysis.

[Competitive Bitcoin Miners Operate At Roughly 90% Margins But New Entrants Must Be Cautious](https://www.hashr8.com/blog/bitcoin-miner-cost-to-mine-hardware-price/) by [@bitcoinnomadic](https://twitter.com/bitcoinnomadic) 

It’s undeniably been an extremely lucrative difficulty epoch for many Bitcoin miners. Despite difficulty rising by 10.79% at the last difficulty adjustment, some miners managed to operate at over 90% margins during the epoch.

[How Much Would it Cost to 51% Attack Bitcoin?](https://braiins.com/blog/how-much-would-it-cost-to-51-attack-bitcoin) by [@braiins_systems](https://twitter.com/braiins_systems)

[There will be bitcoin.](https://sgbarbour.medium.com/there-will-be-bitcoin-d02d486a5d6b) by [@SGBarbour](https://twitter.com/SGBarbour) 

The future of bitcoin mining is oilfield. There is no greater quantity of stranded and wasted energy in the world than there is in oilfield.

[The Intelligent Bitcoin Miner, Part I.](https://www.aniccaresearch.tech/blog/the-intelligent-bitcoin-miner-part-i) by [@leorzhang](https://twitter.com/leorzhang)

This article is a collaboration with General Mining Research, a Singapore based hashpower-focused company, who invests and trades hashpower of cryptocurrency networks, as well as derivatives. GMR supports our work by providing proprietary machine market data, as well as hashrate growth predictions over the next few months based on sales projections aggregated from manufacturers.

[The Alchemy of Hashpower, Part II.](https://www.aniccaresearch.tech/blog/the-alchemy-of-hashpower-part-ii) by [@leorzhang](https://twitter.com/leorzhang) 

In Part I of this series, we presented a simple heuristic for understanding hashpower as an asset class. In mining, everything is connected. To establish a comprehensive understanding of the market dynamic, we need to scrutinize the interactions between the underlying forces in greater depth.
